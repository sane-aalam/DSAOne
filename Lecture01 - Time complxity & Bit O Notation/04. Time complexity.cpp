// * -> Time Complexity in Data Structure
// Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input increases.

//* -> Time Complexity: Sending GTA 5 to a friend: 
// Imagine you have a friend who lives 5 km away from you. You want to send him a game. Since the final exams are over and you want him to get this 60 GB file worth of game from you. How will you send it to him in the shortest time possible?
// Note that both of you are using JIO 4G with a 1 Gb/day data limit.
// The best way would be to send him the game by delivering it to his house. Copy the game to a hard disk and make it reach him physically.
// Would you do the same for sending some small-sized game like MineSweeper which is in KBS of size? Of Course no, because you can now easily send it via the Internet.
// As the file size grows, the time taken to send the game online increases linearly â€“ O(n) while the time taken by sending it physically remains constant. O(1).
